The main topic covered in solving Towers of Hanoi is recursion, being able to use recursion by breaking the problem into smaller problems. Using base cases as the point where recursion stop and how to handle them in a recursive problem such as Towers of Hanoi. Some problems faced in creating Towers of Hanoi is being unable to create a solution iteratively without using a data structure as there is no way to keep track of the the moves and follow the rules of the game using just iteration, a solution to this would be using something like a Stack, or even a queue which we have not yet learned about.
